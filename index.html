		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<h4> I'm a 21 year old Interactive and Graphic design student from Downingtown Pennsylvania. I'm currently taking classes from Millersville University. In my free time I like to spend time playing video games online with my friends. We mainly play League of Legends but will sometimes go through phases where we try other games for a short time. I also like to play Magic the Gathering with my friends from town whenever they are around. This page will show some of the works I've made throughout my college career that I'm most proud of. </h4>

		<h2> Why Design? </h2>
		<h4> I chose to study Graphic Design because of my experiences during high school. My favorite class in high school was by far Biology. My teacher and I had a remarkable bond, at least from my point of view. If you asked him he might've called me his tormentor. Regardless, for his class projects he always let me go above and beyond with creativity. Instead of the traditional poster projects, he'd let me create elaborate (foam) replicas of swords I liked from video games.
		Fast forward a bit to my college years and I was just admitted as a Biology major. But I didn't enjoy it as much as I did in High School. That's when I had the realization that maybe it wasn't the content of Biology, but the creativity I expressed while learning Biology that made me so interested. So I made the massive change from being a Biology major to a Graphic Design major. </h4>

	<h2>Terminal Slam</h2>
	<h4>Terminal Slam is a graphic design piece made with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop meant to visualize the song Terminal Slam by Squarepusher. The song is an electronic piece which progressively becomes more and more chaotic, then calms down again. This made me think of how a virus does the exact same thing. I decided to depict a demonic entity breaking free from containment within a computer. </h4>

	<h4>STEM Wolf is a sculpture meant to bridge the gap between the fields of STEM and art. The sculpture, visually depicting everything to do with STEM through its multiple layered windows, was ultimately created with artistic means. The sculpture is meant to inspire STEM students to think and work creatively.</h4>

	<h2>Pooh</h2>
	<h4>Pooh is a visual representation of 2 contrasting planes coming together. The mascot Pooh is meant to embody something cute, childlike, and innocent. But in this case Pooh has been turned into an abomination. Metal, raw meat, oil, and extra limbs all grow and protrude from Pooh, turning something cute into something horrible.</h4>

	<h4>For the class Sculpture 1, I was tasked with taking an ordinary house object and incorporating it with a posed clay sculpture of a hand in pose. In this sculpture, I wanted to depict a chase between the fox (hand) and the mice (computer mice) with a symbolic meaning of using and consuming computer mice.</h4>

	<h2>Chamomile Tea Great Value Redesign</h2>
	<h4>For this project in Packaging Design I was tasked with picking a package in desperate need of a redesign and creating one. I picked the generic Walmart brand, Great Value, and found packaging for their chamomile tea. Most Great Value designs are terrible in my opinion, and I wanted to create something that would stick out on a shelf and still give off the idea of a great value.</h4>
